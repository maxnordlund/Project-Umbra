 * Project Umbra is a Mhasiran text editor.
 * 
 * It is a text editor for the fictional language Mhasira, which text is written
 * in a special font in vertical columns from left to right.

 * write simple texts with relative ease. The editor displays all correct
 * variations of the characters, something other programs such as word is
 * incapable of.
